I designed and 3D printed this custom desk console, inspired by [Scott Yu-Jan's standby mode dock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3nWw8qSYgk). The goal was to create a multi-functional hub that would help declutter my desk while accommodating my particular devices.

## The Design Process  

I've designed and printed a number of 3d printed phone mounts before, but when I changed my desk setup I realized I wanted a more dedicated spot for all of my devices. When I saw Scott's dock I knew there was a lot of potential to combine that idea with a custom solution to fit my random assortment of things I use on a daily basis.

<div class="flex flex-col items-center w-full my-8">

    />

I wanted the size and shape of the devices I use to be the main driver of the design, so I modeled them all separately in Fusion and spent some time playing with different arrangements. I think I ended up with a pretty good balance between functionality and aesthetics that kept the phone in a good spot while still having easy access to things like my wallet and pens.

### Feature List

- **iPhone Dock:** Phone holder with integrated MagSafe charger + release button 
- **USB Hub:** 7-port powered Anker USB hub
- **Storage:** Compartments for wallet, pens, and small accessories
- **GameCube Adapter:** Built-in adapter mount for playing SSBM
- **Audio Switcher:** Built-in audio switcher for easily switching between devices
- **Cable Routing:** Hidden channels for routing cables out the back for a clean look

After deciding on the layout, it was straightforward to model around them and decide details like the angle of the phone mount.
I did forget about the camera bulge on the back of the phone on the first print, so I had to add those afterwards for both orientations.

### Other Details
Even though this solution is specific to my setup, I think the design strikes a good balance between fitting my exact needs but also allowing for some expansion with the storage in the back. I find that people can go overboard with the capability of 3d-printing and end up with a solution that won't change with their needs.

The phone dock and release button are more or less a copy of Scott's design, but I think I ended up with a more compact solution and it's by far the most satisfying part of the design. My phone looks like an integrated screen when it's in the dock. Another nice feature is that when my phone is in standby mode I can use Tuya smart home widgets to control my lights manually.

## Conclusion
This project perfectly exemplifies why I love 3D printing - the ability to create hyper-specific solutions that you simply can't buy off the shelf. The console has become an essential part of my desk setup. I haven't had to get rid of anything or move them off my desk, and now they all have a dedicated place which makes it feel more organized.
