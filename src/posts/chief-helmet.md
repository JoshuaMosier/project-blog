I created this custom floating Master Chief helmet as a personal project to combine my love of Halo, 3D printing, and some light engineering.

## The Build Process  

This build took me about 3-4 weeks to complete, blending detailed resin 3D printing, precision painting, and magnetic levitation to achieve the floating effect. Here’s a quick overview of the key elements:  

- **3D printed Master Chief helmet model** – The helmet body and visor were printed separately.  
- **Custom levitation base** – designed after the cortana AI chip to house the electronics.  
- **Magnetic levitation kit** – a diy maglev unit using both rare-earth and electromagnets.  
- **Hand-painted details** – featuring metallic gold for the visor and Halo’s classic olive green armor finish.  

## Technical Details  

The 3D printing process alone required around **18 hours of total print time**:  
- 12 hours for the two helmet halves.  
- 6 hours for the base components.  

Resin-based 3D printing allowed for incredible precision, capturing every detail of the helmet design. Post-printing, the pieces underwent thorough cleaning, curing, and sanding to achieve a smooth surface for painting.  

The **levitation platform** was designed after the cortana AI chip to conceal the maglev electronics within a sleek base that adds to the sci-fi aesthetic. The final display measures approximately 20 centimeters high.

## Learning Experience  

This project was a fun challenge that taught me a lot—especially about combining creative design with technical engineering. Achieving a realistic floating effect was a fun challenge, but seeing the helmet float for the first time was *incredibly* rewarding.  

Painting was another highlight of the build. Using acrylics, metallic washes, and weathering techniques, I was able to bring out the Master Chief’s iconic battle-worn look.

This floating helmet combines fan art, craftsmanship, and some Halo-inspired innovation—making it one of my favorite projects to date. Whether you’re a gamer or just enjoy seeing 3D printing brought to life, this piece is a small tribute to the legendary Spartan himself.
