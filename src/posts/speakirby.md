For our family's "Sibling Santa" gift exchange, I designed and 3D-printed a Super Smash Bros. Melee-styled trophy featuring Kirby, with a removable Bluetooth speaker module integrated into his mouth.

## Design Process

The design was inspired by the trophy collection from Super Smash Bros. Melee, featuring Kirby in his classic pose on a golden base. I modeled the design in Fusion 360, ensuring the mouth opening would perfectly fit a standard Bluetooth speaker module while maintaining the character's iconic proportions.

- Created the basic Kirby shape using reference images from SSBM
- Designed the mouth cavity to securely hold a removable Bluetooth speaker
- Engineered the base with proper support for the top-heavy design
- Added subtle details to match the SSBM trophy aesthetic

## Printing and Finishing

The trophy was printed in multiple parts using PLA:
- Main Kirby body in pink PLA
- Base in gold-colored PLA
- Custom-designed internal mounting system for the speaker

The finishing process was crucial for achieving a professional look:
1. Carefully primed the printed parts
2. Airbrushed the body to achieve a smooth, even pink finish
3. Created custom eye designs and printed them on sticker paper
4. Applied the eye stickers
5. Sealed with clear coat for durability
