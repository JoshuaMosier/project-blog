  "boxx": "I built these custom arcade-style Super Smash Bros. Melee controllers as a birthday gift for my brother. Click on the gallery above for more images and videos of both builds! ## The Build Process This build is actually two separate controllers, Version 1 was built in July 2021 and Version 2 was built in June 2023. ## Version 1 ### V1 Components - **Frame:** Two-part MDF frame - **Keycaps:** SLA resin printed - **Switchplate:** Custom steel switchplate from sendcutsend - **Microcontroller:** Raspberry pi pico running [haybox firmware](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/HayBox). - **Gamecube Cable:** I soldered a cable from the pico and hand-crimped and asssembled the gamecube adapter port. Version 1 was built more or less based off the original smash boxx design. I designed a two part frame with a top panel and bottom plate that sandwiched the steel switchplate. The switch wiring was pretty simple to hand solder together with a raspberry pi pico and some electrical tape to isolate the wires and pico from the switchplate. The assembly was a bit tedious having to manually drill out each button mounting hole based on the switch plate, but in the end it came together pretty well. My brother used version as his primary controller for over a year but eventually found the buttons started to wear against the side of the case and weren't as reliable for high APM play. As a birthday gift I decided to build a version 2 taking into account some of the lessons I learned from the first build. ## Version 2 This time I new that I wanted to try and customize the shape of the controller a bit more and make it more durable. ### V2 Components - **Frame:** Resin printed case from JLC & Steel backplate from sendcutsend - **Keycaps:** Multicolor PLA & Nylon - **Switchplate:** Integrated into the case - **Microcontroller:** Raspberry pi pico running [haybox firmware](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/HayBox). - **Gamecube Cable:** Detachable USB-C to GCC cable - **Misc:** Foam insert, adhesive neoprene, and threaded inserts to mount the backplate. ### Design Changes I modelled a new shape based on the frame1 button layout and integrated the switch mountingplate into the case. I ordered two cases to be resin printed from JLC and then sanded, primed, painted them matte black, and clear coated them with SprayMax 2k so it will stand up to oil and sweat. The additional features with this build were filling the internal space with a custom laser-cut foam insert to dampen the sound of the switches. The controller backplate was also made of steel this time and I added adhesive neoprene rubber pad underneath to make it more comfortable and give it a bit more grip. This time, instead of wiring the switches directly to the pico I used switch sockets to make it easier to swap out switches. The first iteration of the keycaps were multicolor printed with my Bambulab X1C to label each of the buttons. ### Final Touches After version 2 was completed, I added a USB-C port to the case with a detachable cable, along with a mini-keyboard carrying case which perfectly fit the controller. I also custom ordered a set of nylon keycaps from JLC to match the aesthetic of the controller. ## Conclusion I've been very pleased with how both builds turned out, but version 2 definitely took it up a notch with the aesthetics where it now feels like a real product. The controller has lasted over a year now and is still in great condition, I will have to see if there is a v3 in the future with a custom PCB.",
  "chief-helmet": "I created this custom floating Master Chief helmet as a personal project to combine my love of Halo, 3D printing, and some light engineering. ## The Build Process This build took me about 3-4 weeks to complete, blending detailed resin 3D printing, precision painting, and magnetic levitation to achieve the floating effect. Here’s a quick overview of the key elements: - **3D printed Master Chief helmet model** – The helmet body and visor were printed separately. - **Custom levitation base** – designed after the cortana AI chip to house the electronics. - **Magnetic levitation kit** – a diy maglev unit using both rare-earth and electromagnets. - **Hand-painted details** – featuring metallic gold for the visor and Halo’s classic olive green armor finish. ## Technical Details The 3D printing process alone required around **18 hours of total print time**: - 12 hours for the two helmet halves. - 6 hours for the base components. Resin-based 3D printing allowed for incredible precision, capturing every detail of the helmet design. Post-printing, the pieces underwent thorough cleaning, curing, and sanding to achieve a smooth surface for painting. The **levitation platform** was designed after the cortana AI chip to conceal the maglev electronics within a sleek base that adds to the sci-fi aesthetic. The final display measures approximately 20 centimeters high. ## Learning Experience This project was a fun challenge that taught me a lot—especially about combining creative design with technical engineering. Achieving a realistic floating effect was a fun challenge, but seeing the helmet float for the first time was *incredibly* rewarding. Painting was another highlight of the build. Using acrylics, metallic washes, and weathering techniques, I was able to bring out the Master Chief’s iconic battle-worn look. --- This floating helmet combines fan art, craftsmanship, and some Halo-inspired innovation—making it one of my favorite projects to date. Whether you’re a gamer or just enjoy seeing 3D printing brought to life, this piece is a small tribute to the legendary Spartan himself. ---",

  "coin-holder": "Recently, I saw this meme and normally wouldn't think twice about it, but it made me wonder if there was a better option for dealing with change other than rounding up a transaction or keeping coins jangling in your pocket. Now, I typically never pay with cash when I have the option of using a credit card, and I can honestly say I've never paid with exact change other than quarters. However, this problem seemed particularly interesting to me as a project because: 1. There was a clear objective (make something that holds coins more better-er) 2. There were obvious optimization constraints (make it as small/thin as possible) 3. It represented a solution to an almost universal problem ( ... from 20 years ago) 4. I hadn't seen anyone attempt something similar before 5. I thought it would be a good use of 3D-printing Considering these factors, the idea fell into the unique category of having a clear objective, interesting design parameters, and _initially_ didn't seem like it would be that complicated (a classic). ## The Design Process ### Precedence I didn't start out researching if this existed and instead assumed that because I hadn't seen it before it meant it simply never existed. It was only later on in the design process that I spent some time looking for similar examples. I was positive that humans had simply spent too much time carrying around change to not have already tried thinking of a better solution. I was mostly correct and found a few different examples after some googling and checking a few different LLMs with deepsearch. The closest overall was definitely but I found some examples from etsy for coin holders as well. ChangeCard had clearly already come up with a similar concept, although not for the same purpose. It was designed as a \"unique educational tool that teaches kids how to make change, how to manage money, and how to understand America's monetary system\", and \"primarily as a promotional product\". So its intention was not to allow someone to conveniently store coins and make exact change for a purchase, but instead as a tool or game to teach someone to make exact change. I couldn't find any examples of the physical changecard product \\(the website has clearly not been updated since the early 2000s\\), but I did find a few product listings on etsy of coin holders. However, the etsy designs either did not have the proper number of coins to make perfect change, weren't designed for US coins, or were too large to fit in the credit card slot of a wallet. So I continued working on this with only the slight disappointment of not having come up with a novel idea. ### Constraints #### Optimal Coin Set There were a few design aspects I decided on immediately. The first was that I needed to use as few coins as possible to make any value from 1-99. Calculating the minimum number of coins needed is a fun math problem I had done in school, feel free to give it a try if you don't already know the answer. Click to reveal the solution The optimal solution is 10 coins \\(8 if you used a half-dollar\\), but there are actually 2 different sets of 10 that will work. * Set 1: 3 Quarters, 1 Dime, 2 Nickels, 4 Pennies * Set 2: 3 Quarters, 2 Dimes, 1 Nickel, 4 Pennies Both sets use 10 total coins, but Set 2 actually totals to $1.04 instead of Set 1's 99¢. More importantly for us, a dime is smaller than a nickel, so we should be able to find a more compact arrangement using Set 2 as well \\(and can make change for a whole dollar!\\) #### Dimensions The other main constraints were the dimensions of the coin holder. The original intention was to make this as thin as possible, and the nickel is the thickest coin we need to use (1.95 mm) so we can't do any better than that. For length and width, the natural starting place was to match the dimensions of a credit card to make it compatible with almost every wallet. The standard dimensions for credit cards are 85.6 × 54.0 mm with an approximate area of 4,620 mm². A smarter person would have pulled out a credit card and tested to see if they could fit the 10 coins on top, but let's do some napkin math to see if it's possible. Looking at the [coin specifications](https://www.usmint.gov/learn/coins-and-medals/circulating-coins/coin-specifications) from the US mint, we can calculate the total area of our coins. | Coin | Diameter (mm) | Area (mm²) | Quantity | Total Area (mm²) | |------|--------------|------------|-----------|-----------------| | Quarter | 24.26 | 462.2 | 3 | 1,386.6 | | Dime | 17.91 | 252.0 | 2 | 504.0 | | Nickel | 21.21 | 353.3 | 1 | 353.3 | | Penny | 19.05 | 285.0 | 4 | 1,140.0 | | **Total** | | | **10** | **3,383.9** | Total Area = π × (radius)² for each coin = 3,383.9 mm² This total area is actually less than the area of a credit card (4,600 mm²), so it should theoretically be possible to fit all the coins within the footprint of a credit card. However, this calculation assumes perfect packing efficiency, which isn't possible with circular shapes. For identical circles, the optimal packing efficiency is π/4 or about 78.5%. If we take our total coin area of 3,384 mm² divided by the maximum area of 4,620 mm², we need to achieve at least 73.2% packing efficiency, which suggests that it may be possible. ### Packing Simulation Packing circles of unequal sizes is an NP-hard problem, so it's almost impossible to say which physical arrangement of coins is going to be optimal. There is actually quite a lot of research on this specific problem, but for simplicity (and based on the advice of Gemini 2.5) we can use simulation to find out if it's possible to arrange the coins in the area of a credit card and determine some of the compact arrangements. #### Simulated Annealing To solve this packing problem, I used a simulated annealing algorithm - a probabilistic technique inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy where metals are heated and slowly cooled to reduce defects. The algorithm works by: 1. Starting with a random arrangement of coins within the credit card boundaries 2. Repeatedly making small random adjustments to coin positions 3. Accepting changes that improve the arrangement (reduce overlaps and boundary violations) 4. Sometimes accepting worse arrangements early in the process to avoid getting stuck in local optima 5. Gradually \"cooling\" the system to settle into a final arrangement The cost function evaluates how \"good\" an arrangement is by calculating: - How much coins overlap with each other (which we want to minimize to zero) - How much coins extend beyond the credit card boundaries - The total compactness of the arrangement Github Link: I ran this script several times and was eventually able to find at least one arrangement that produced a valid solution: #### Caveats Even though I found out it was possible to optimally arrange the set of coins within the boundary of a card, there were a few reasons I had to relax the constraints. I wanted to avoid non-symmetrical layouts for aesthetics and ideally I would place larger value coins closer together. This way it would be more natural to access coins starting quarter --> dime --> nickel --> penny to follow the mental math process of computing the total change amount. Additionally, I knew that I would need some amount of tolerance for coins that may be shaped slightly differently than others. I was able to find another solution with a symmetrical coin layout with a very small overlap cost. This one met my criteria, and if I kept the target width of 85.6mm and used 1mm spacing between each coin I could fit the layout only 3mm larger than the normal height of a credit card. ### Initial Design #### Transition Fit Now that I had the layout decided, I started mocking up sketches in Fusion. Configuring the layout of the coins was simple, but the next thing I had to determine was how someone was going to insert and remove coins without them falling out. The usual suspect here was using a small offset in the design \\(0.1-0.3mm\\) so that if you inserted a coin from the top you could press it into the slot for each coin. If I added a small cutout below each coin you would also be able to push it out from the bottom. An extra layer would be to draft the angles inward by a few degrees so that coins which might be worn down on the edges would still be retained. This design would work well enough for a tuned 3D printer but wouldn't be guaranteed to work if extrusion was off by even +/- 0.1mm. Testing a few different coins, I also found that coins themselves could be off by 0.2mm in diameter so a brand-new coin might stick out and an old one may only be barely held in. When I tried to decrease the perimeter of material holding on to each coin and lowering the spacing, it compensated well but would cause the card to bend slightly from the pressure in the plastic holding the coins. ### 3D Printing Optimizations #### Snapfit A more reliable design to account for variation in coin sizes would be to use a snapfit or over-center mechanism. By using the natural flexibility of 3D printed parts, we can design a gap that is smaller than the diameter of a coin, and by pushing the coin we can expand that gap to insert a coin. As long as the part isn't stressed too much, the piece will flex back into place and create a gap that is now holding the coin in place. By experimenting with different cross sections, thickness, plastics, etc. you can control the amount of stiffness and make it easier or harder to insert or remove a coin. Snap-fits can be tricky to design without using supports but are under-utilized for 3D printing parts that can be printed and assembly without fasteners. #### Edge Coins For the coins on the outside edge of the holder, I used a gap width 0.2 mm smaller than the original coin diameter and created the holding cavity with a diameter 0.2 mm larger. That probably seems like a small amount, but it is the difference between the coin requiring force to insert and spinning freely in the holding cavity. The extra benefit of this design is that we are only stressing the plastic when moving the coin, so we avoid 'creep' that may cause the flexure to become overworked and weakened over time. To hold the coin from above, I added a chamfered transition to a circle 1.2 mm smaller so that the coin would not fall out if the holder was turned upside down. On the bottom edge, I added a slot cutout which makes it easier to pinch the coin from the top and bottom when inserting/removing. #### Interior Coins There are two coins on the interior of the holder, a quarter and a nickel. It's not possible to use the same snapfit techniques for these coins since there isn't enough space to insert them from the side. We still have our same problems from the transition fit from before, so I tried to come up with something more clever. We need something that can snugly fit coins which are slightly over and under sized. My approach was to design an 'arm' that by default is narrower than the coin but can flex outwards to fit the coin. This way the coin can be inserted from the top, and the arm will apply pressure from the side to keep the coin in place. #### Layer Heights and Widths Another significant design consideration was to keep in mind how the 3D model would be sliced for printing. 0.2 mm is a standard layer height for most printers, so every vertical thickness of the coin holder is a multiple of 0.2 mm. This worked out well for the spacing of the coins since the thickness of coins are also near multiples of 0.2 mm (1.75 mm for a quarter, 1.35 mm for a dime, 1.95 mm for a nickel, 1.52 mm for a penny). To keep the holder somewhat rigid, I use 0.6 mm (3 layers) for the top and bottom layers and default 1.6 mm for the coin holders. That puts the total height of the holder at 2.8 mm or about 3.5 credit cards thick. Some material could likely be saved by thinning out the top and bottom but would sacrifice rigidity. Layer width was another critical consideration. The width of the line being laid by the print head can technically vary, but I find it best to design in intervals of 0.4 mm. This is especially important when defining the thickness of walls between coins. If the wall is too thin, the slicer may 'delete' portions of the wall below the layer width and cause gaps. Similarly, I round sharp corners to intervals of 0.4 mm which generally results in a smoother path for the print head. ## Final Design Between the transition fit and snap fit designs, I went through at least 20 different test prints. Many of those were subtle adjustments to spacing before I settled on the final iteration. The print is less than 6g of total filament, and the print time is about 15-20 minutes on my X1C and H2D printers. Print one yourself: Interactive Coin Holder 3D model ## Conclusion Overall this was a fun project to turn around in just a few days and I'm pleased with the result. The combination of the project constraints, simulated packing, and design optimization was good practice combining my skillsets. I'll personally keep this in my backpack just in case I need to make change or need a spare coin for heads or tails, but I'm sure it'll be helpful to the right person. #### Files * * *",
  "desk-console": "I designed and 3D printed this custom desk console, inspired by [Scott Yu-Jan's standby mode dock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3nWw8qSYgk). The goal was to create a multi-functional hub that would help declutter my desk while accommodating my particular devices. ## The Design Process I've designed and printed a number of 3d printed phone mounts before, but when I changed my desk setup I realized I wanted a more dedicated spot for all of my devices. When I saw Scott's dock I knew there was a lot of potential to combine that idea with a custom solution to fit my random assortment of things I use on a daily basis. I wanted the size and shape of the devices I use to be the main driver of the design, so I modeled them all separately in Fusion and spent some time playing with different arrangements. I think I ended up with a pretty good balance between functionality and aesthetics that kept the phone in a good spot while still having easy access to things like my wallet and pens. ### Feature List - **iPhone Dock:** Phone holder with integrated MagSafe charger + release button - **USB Hub:** 7-port powered Anker USB hub - **Storage:** Compartments for wallet, pens, and small accessories - **GameCube Adapter:** Built-in adapter mount for playing SSBM - **Audio Switcher:** Built-in audio switcher for easily switching between devices - **Cable Routing:** Hidden channels for routing cables out the back for a clean look After deciding on the layout, it was straightforward to model around them and decide details like the angle of the phone mount. I did forget about the camera bulge on the back of the phone on the first print, so I had to add those afterwards for both orientations. ### Other Details Even though this solution is specific to my setup, I think the design strikes a good balance between fitting my exact needs but also allowing for some expansion with the storage in the back. I find that people can go overboard with the capability of 3d-printing and end up with a solution that won't change with their needs. The phone dock and release button are more or less a copy of Scott's design, but I think I ended up with a more compact solution and it's by far the most satisfying part of the design. My phone looks like an integrated screen when it's in the dock. Another nice feature is that when my phone is in standby mode I can use Tuya smart home widgets to control my lights manually. ## Conclusion This project perfectly exemplifies why I love 3D printing - the ability to create hyper-specific solutions that you simply can't buy off the shelf. The console has become an essential part of my desk setup. I haven't had to get rid of anything or move them off my desk, and now they all have a dedicated place which makes it feel more organized.",
  "ghost-banshee": "## Halo Reach: Ghost ## Halo Reach: Banshee I created these custom floating Halo Ghost and Banshee models as part of a secret santa project. Click on the image galleries above to see more of the build process! ## The Build Process This project started in October 2021 and was completed in December 2021. Here's a quick overview of the key elements: - **3D printed Ghost and Banshee models** – Each Covenant vehicle was modeled after the game assets and printed in multiple parts for optimal detail. - **Custom levitation bases** – Designed to house the electronics and complement the Covenant aesthetic featuring the seventh column logo - **Magnetic levitation kit** – DIY maglev units using both rare-earth and electromagnets - **Wireless LED system** – Custom-integrated lighting that powers on without physical connections through wireless power coils. - **Hand-painted details** – Featuring the iconic purple/blue Covenant color scheme with color-shiftmetallic finishes ## Technical Details The 3D printing process went through multiple iterations: - Initial prototypes in PLA to test fit and levitation - Final versions in resin for superior detail and finish - Multiple test prints to perfect the wireless LED housing Resin-based 3D printing allowed for incredible precision, capturing every detail of these iconic Covenant vehicles. Post-printing, the pieces underwent thorough cleaning, curing, and sanding to achieve a smooth surface for painting. The levitation platforms were designed to conceal the maglev electronics while maintaining the Covenant aesthetic. The wireless LED system was particularly challenging to integrate, requiring careful consideration of weight distribution to maintain stable levitation while achieving the underside glow. ## Learning Experience This project was a fun challenge building from some of my previous projects with these DIY maglev kits like the [Baby Yoda Crib](/posts/maglev-baby-yoda). I always enjoy pushing the envelope with these projects so I'm super pleased with how the wireless LEDs turned out.",
  "maglev-baby-yoda": "A custom magnetic levitating Baby Yoda display I created as a Christmas gift for my sister, combining 3D printing, painting, and electronics to bring a piece of The Mandalorian to life. ## The Build Process This project was a labor of love that took about 3-4 weeks to complete. It combines several elements: - 3D printed Baby Yoda model from Inspyre 3D - Modified floating pram from Multiverse3DDesigns - Custom-designed base created in Meshmixer - Magnetic levitation kit for the floating effect - Hand-painted details using acrylics and wash paints ## Technical Details The build involved approximately 15 hours of total print time: - 10 hours for the pram - 2.5 hours for Baby Yoda - 2.5 hours for the base The base features a Beskar ingot-inspired design with the Empire logo, cleverly concealing the magnetic levitation electronics. The finished piece measures about 15 centimeters in diameter, making it a perfect desk display piece. ## Learning Experience This project represented several firsts for me, including my first experience with finishing and painting 3D prints.

  "metalcasting": "I've been exploring metal casting using a Devilforge furnace to melt aluminum cans into custom medals, rings, and coins. ### Equipment List - **Furnace:** Devilforge propane furnace - **Crucible:** #4 Clay graphite crucible - **Mold Material:** Petrobond/Greensand - **Safety Gear:** Heat resistant gloves, face shield, leather apron - **Source Material:** Recycled aluminum cans ## Project Examples ### March Madness Tournament Medal The tournament medal was my first major casting project. I designed the medal in Blender with a realistic basketball texture. I printed the master pattern in resin with a tab to later attach a ribbon. This took a few attempts to get the mold right with greensand, but I was able to get a decent cast. ### Custom rings These rings were made mostly to test the precision of the casting and to practice surface finishing. The mold worked beautfilly but there was a lot of porosity in the cast. The rings were also surprisingly light but still felt durable. ### Themed coins These coins were made to show off the casting to friends and family. The coins pictured here are a mandalorian medallion, pirate treasure, a bitcoin, and a witcher medallion. ## Learning Experience This has definitely been an interesting experience, previously I wouldn't have thought I'd be able to make custom cast parts at home this easily. To go from 3d printing the master to casting a finished product has become not only a fun hobby, but also a useful skill to have. Since these projects I've switched to mainly using petrobond for the better surface detail in the mold, but I've also purchased a kayacast investment casting machine and a tabletop burnout furnace to try out lost-wax casting with resin parts.",
  "movie-posters": "I built a Python application that generates movie posters made up of thousands of tiny movie poster thumbnails. The program analyzes colors to create a larger image mosaic while maintaining visual coherence. ## The Technical Challenge Creating photo mosaics presents several interesting technical challenges: - Analyzing and matching colors effectively across thousands of images - Optimizing image processing for reasonable performance - Maintaining visual quality at both macro and micro scales - Handling different poster aspect ratios and sizes The core of the solution uses k-d trees for efficient color matching and PIL for image processing. Here's a simplified example of how the color matching works: ```python def build_kd_tree(color_data): points = [] filenames = [] for filename, details in color_data.items(): dominant_color = details['colors'][0] points.append(dominant_color) filenames.append(filename) return KDTree(points), filenames ``` ## Image Processing Pipeline The full process involves several steps: 1. Download and preprocess movie poster images 2. Extract dominant colors from each poster 3. Build a searchable color database 4. Generate the mosaic by matching target colors 5. Create final output in multiple sizes with proper DPI ## Optimization Techniques Some key optimizations I implemented: - Caching preprocessed image data in JSON - Using numpy for faster color calculations - Implementing parallel processing for image analysis - Pre-filtering images based on color characteristics ## Production Features Beyond the core mosaic generation, I added several features for production use: - Multiple output sizes (16x20\", 18x24\", 24x36\") - Border and borderless variants - High-resolution 300 DPI output - Preview image generation - Automated listing photo creation ## Lessons Learned This project taught me a lot about: - Color space mathematics and perception - Image processing optimization techniques - Working with large datasets of images - Balancing quality vs performance tradeoffs The most challenging aspect was tuning the color matching algorithm to produce visually pleasing results while maintaining reasonable processing times. *Built with Python, PIL, numpy, and lots of movie posters*",
  "music-box-homecoming": "> **TL;DR:** I transcribed Samsung’s “Homecoming” alarm tone, tracked down a mechanical music-box comb that could actually play it, and 3-D-printed a custom enclosure so the modern digital ringtone can ring out from true analog clockwork. ## Digital Meets Mechanical Samsung’s *Homecoming* alarm is a curious hybrid: it sounds like an old-school music box, yet it was produced entirely in software. That paradox made me wonder—could I reverse the process and make the tune *physical* again? This post walks through: 1. Locating a clean MIDI copy of the ringtone. 2. Learning that most retail music boxes are **not chromatic** (they skip notes!). 3. Matching the ringtone’s melody to whatever note sets *do* exist. 4. Ordering a handful of 18-note comb mechanisms from Amazon. 5. Designing & printing a new drum and housing so the comb can play *Homecoming* faithfully. --- ## 1. Finding the MIDI I first grabbed a YouTube rip of the alarm, but background hiss made note detection messy. After some spelunking on XDA forums I found a leaked system dump that contained `Homecoming.ogg`. A quick conversion in **Audacity** plus Melodyne’s note-detection gave me a rough MIDI. ![Melodyne screenshot](/posts/music-box/melodyne.png) Cleaning and quantising in **MuseScore** left me with a tidy 2-bar melody in C major. ```midi C5 E5 G5 A5 G5 E5 C5 (rest) A4 C5 E5 F5 E5 C5 A4 ``` --- ## 2. The Chromatic Gap Problem Off-the-shelf crank music boxes use 15- or 18-note combs, but **they skip accidentals** to keep cost down. Common pattern for 18-note comb: ``` C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 A4 B4 C5 D5 E5 F5 G5 A5 B5 C6 D6 E6 F6 ``` Notice there’s **no C# / D# / F# / G# / A#**. Fortunately *Homecoming* sits nicely inside the white keys—except one pesky high B♭. ### Comb shopping spreadsheet | Vendor | Range | Missing notes | Works? | |--------|-------|---------------|--------| | Sankyo 18-note (Amazon) | C4–F6 | all sharps | ✅ yes | | Unknown 15-note (eBay) | G3–E5 | no sharps | ❌ too low | A Sankyo 18-note won. --- ## 3. Remapping the Melody One note—B♭—was still off-limits. I dropped it an octave and the ear hardly notices. Here’s the adjusted score highlighted on the comb’s tooth map: --- ## 4. Designing the Drum & Case The Sankyo mechanism ships with a blank paper strip and punch. Fun, but tedious. Instead I: 1. Exported the final MIDI to **CSV**. 2. Wrote a small Python script (see GitHub link in footer) that turns timestamps into peg coordinates. 3. Modeled a drum in **Fusion 360** with peg holes. 4. Printed the drum in PETG and the enclosure in silk PLA. ![Printed parts](/posts/music-box/printed-parts.jpg) The comb bolts in place; a crank fits onto the drum axle. --- ## 5. Assembly & First Play Moment of truth—after 15 minutes of gentle filing the drum spun freely. Cranking it the first time was strangely nerve-wracking… It works! The shifted B♭ is imperceptible unless you’re actively listening for it. --- ## 6. What I Learned * **Digital → Analog translation** is sometimes simpler than it looks when the source melody is diatonic. * 3-D printing replaceable drums is far faster than punching paper strips. * Old mechanisms + new fabrication = delightful hybrid projects. ---",
  "nutricient": "A web application that optimizes meal choices in Virginia Tech dining halls using linear programming to help students maintain balanced nutrition while meeting their dietary goals. ## The Problem Many college students struggle to maintain a balanced diet while eating in dining halls. Whether trying to meet specific fitness goals, manage allergies, or simply eat healthily, it can be overwhelming to analyze nutritional information for every meal option.

  "on-air": "It started with a simple problem: interruptions. Like many people, I’ve struggled to stay productive while working from home. Whether it was a roommate popping in during a meeting or family members not realizing I was trying to concentrate, I found myself needing a better way to communicate “I’m busy.” ## The Idea The concept was pretty straightforward: a small light that anyone could use to show when they’re busy, available, or need some quiet time. But I wanted to take it a step further. Instead of just being a “red light/green light” system, I thought: - Why not make it smart? - Why not integrate it with tools people already use, like Teams, Zoom, or Slack? ## What On Air Does *On Air* is essentially a connected status indicator, but it’s packed with features to make it flexible and useful: - **Customizable Colors and Patterns:** You can set up the colors and animations that work for you—whether it’s a steady red light for “Do Not Disturb”, green for \"I'm available”, or yellow for \"My meeting ends soon.” - **App and Calendar Syncing:** The light can automatically update based on your meeting schedule or even your status in tools like Microsoft Teams. - **Voice Assistant Integration:** You can change your status hands-free with Alexa or Google Assistant. - **Smart Automations:** The light can adapt to your environment. For example, it dims in the evening or changes based on triggers you set. ## Building the Project I learned a lot while building this. The biggest challenge was getting it to integrate seamlessly with all the tools people use—everyone has their own workflow, and *On Air* needed to fit into as many as possible. We also had to make sure it was easy to use right out of the box while still offering advanced features for power users. The hardware itself went through several iterations to get the size, brightness, and design just right. I wanted it to look clean and modern—something that could sit on a desk without feeling out of place. ## What’s Next There are so many possibilities for where this project could go. Some ideas I’m excited about: - Adding more platform integrations for things like Zoom Room systems or gaming setups. - Expanding environmental awareness, like automatically adjusting brightness based on room lighting. - Creating specialized modes for different use cases, like “focus” sessions or parental controls. ## Why It Matters Ultimately, I hope *On Air* makes it a little easier to carve out focus time in an increasingly noisy world. Whether you’re working, studying, or streaming, it’s a simple tool to help others respect your time and space.",

  "pullback": "For our kinematics term project, we developed a functional pullback toy car mechanism using 3D printing. The mechanism uses a gear system and spring to convert backward motion into forward movement through a dual gear train system. ## How It Works The pullback mechanism operates through a simple principle: when the car is pulled backward, the rear wheels' rotation engages a gear train connected to a torsion spring. The gearbox contains two gear trains - one for winding (reverse) and one for release (forward). Our calculations showed: - Theoretical output/input ratio: 12.25:1 - Measured displacement ratio: 22-25:1 - Reverse gear train ratio: 147:8 - Forward gear train ratio: 1.5:1 ## Design and Implementation The project involved: - CAD modeling in Fusion 360 - Gear design optimization to reduce interference - 3D printing on an Artillery Sidewinder X1 - Assembly with focus on the spring mechanism - TPU material for rear tire traction The design uses translating pink and orange gears that mesh with the main blue gear. This creates separate gear trains for forward and reverse movement, allowing for the difference between input and output displacement. ## Testing Results Testing of the mechanism showed: - Travel distance up to 15 feet from full pullback - First prototype: 22:1 displacement ratio - Second prototype: 25:1 displacement ratio - Consistent performance in repeated tests ## Lessons Learned The project provided experience with: - Gear train design - 3D printing tolerances - Spring mechanics - Material selection [Watch the demonstration →](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9JcV-hAEtk) *This project was completed as part of ME 3604 coursework by Josh Mosier and Zach Sucher.*",

  "senior-design": "As part of my senior design team at Virginia Tech, we tackled this problem by developing a novel haptic wristband that could bridge the communication gap between robots and their human operators. ## The Problem When working with robotic systems, particularly in shared autonomy scenarios, it's often unclear what the robot has learned or when it needs additional guidance. Traditional visual feedback requires constantly watching the robot, which isn't always practical when you need to multitask. We needed a way to let the robot \"tap you on the wrist\" when it needed help. ## The Solution Our solution was a lightweight, wireless haptic wristband that provides two types of feedback: - A gentle squeeze mechanism that can alert the user when the robot needs attention - Six vibrotactors arranged around the wrist that can create directional patterns to guide user input ## Building the Device ### The Squeeze Mechanism One of our biggest innovations was the cord and reel system controlled by a high-torque N20 DC motor. We designed it to provide gentle but noticeable squeeze notifications while keeping the band comfortable during extended wear. The cord is never in direct contact with the wearer's skin, and we normally keep it in a relaxed state. ### Vibrotactile Feedback We incorporated six cylindrical ERM motors evenly spaced around the wristband. Each vibrotactor sits in a custom resin-printed housing that transfers vibrations directly to the skin. One of the trickiest parts was designing the accordion-style band that could fit different wrist sizes while keeping vibrations isolated between motors. ### Housing Design The electronics housing went through several iterations before we got it right. We needed to fit the microcontroller, battery, squeeze mechanism, and motor drivers in a compact package while keeping it lightweight and comfortable. The final design uses a modular approach that makes assembly and maintenance straightforward. ## Technical Challenges Some of the biggest challenges we faced included: - Designing a flexible band that could accommodate different wrist sizes while maintaining consistent haptic feedback - Creating a squeeze mechanism that was both gentle and reliable - Managing power consumption to ensure the wireless device could operate for extended periods - Isolating vibrations between motors to create clear directional cues ## Results Our user studies showed that the wristband, when combined with augmented reality feedback, significantly improved human-robot interaction. Users could focus on other tasks while remaining responsive to the robot's needs, and the directional haptic cues helped them provide more effective guidance when needed. ## Future Possibilities This project opened up exciting possibilities for human-robot interaction. Some potential future developments include: - Adding more sophisticated haptic patterns for complex communications - Incorporating additional sensors for context-aware feedback - Developing specialized versions for different industrial or assistive robotics applications - Exploring applications beyond robotics in areas like VR/AR interaction --- Looking back, this project taught me invaluable lessons about hardware development, user-centered design, and the importance of multimodal feedback in human-robot interaction. It's exciting to see how a relatively simple device can make such a meaningful difference in how humans and robots work together.",
  "speakirby": "For our family's \"Sibling Santa\" gift exchange, I designed and 3D-printed a Super Smash Bros. Melee-styled trophy featuring Kirby, with a removable Bluetooth speaker module integrated into his mouth. ## Design Process The design was inspired by the trophy collection from Super Smash Bros. Melee, featuring Kirby in his classic pose on a golden base. I modeled the design in Fusion 360, ensuring the mouth opening would perfectly fit a standard Bluetooth speaker module while maintaining the character's iconic proportions. - Created the basic Kirby shape using reference images from SSBM - Designed the mouth cavity to securely hold a removable Bluetooth speaker - Engineered the base with proper support for the top-heavy design - Added subtle details to match the SSBM trophy aesthetic ## Printing and Finishing The trophy was printed in multiple parts using PLA: - Main Kirby body in pink PLA - Base in gold-colored PLA - Custom-designed internal mounting system for the speaker The finishing process was crucial for achieving a professional look: 1.
