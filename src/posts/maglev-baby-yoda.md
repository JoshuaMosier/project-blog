A custom magnetic levitating Baby Yoda display I created as a Christmas gift for my sister, combining 3D printing, painting, and electronics to bring a piece of The Mandalorian to life.

## The Build Process

This project was a labor of love that took about 3-4 weeks to complete. It combines several elements:

- 3D printed Baby Yoda model from Inspyre 3D
- Modified floating pram from Multiverse3DDesigns
- Custom-designed base created in Meshmixer
- Magnetic levitation kit for the floating effect
- Hand-painted details using acrylics and wash paints

## Technical Details

The build involved approximately 15 hours of total print time:
- 10 hours for the pram
- 2.5 hours for Baby Yoda
- 2.5 hours for the base

The base features a Beskar ingot-inspired design with the Empire logo, cleverly concealing the magnetic levitation electronics. The finished piece measures about 15 centimeters in diameter, making it a perfect desk display piece.

## Learning Experience

This project represented several firsts for me, including my first experience with finishing and painting 3D prints. While there was definitely a learning curve, the end result was worth the effort. The combination of the floating pram and the hand-painted details really brings the piece to life.
