A handcrafted 3D wooden map of Virginia Tech's campus, created as a unique Secret Santa gift. This multi-layered piece combines laser-cut Baltic birch plywood with detailed engravings of campus roads, paths, and buildings to create a striking dimensional representation of the university grounds.

## Design Process

The project began with a Virginia Tech campus PDF map, which I converted into separate vector layers for the various map elements. This allowed for precise control over:

- Building footprints for the raised 3D elements
- Road networks and walking paths
- Background terrain details
- Campus boundaries and landmarks

## Fabrication

Using the makerspace laser cutter in my dorm, I brought the design to life through multiple steps:

- Base layer: Laser engraved the ground details and cut the road networks
- Building layer: Precision cut all campus buildings from a second sheet of Baltic birch
- Assembly: Carefully glued each building in its exact location
- Finishing touches: Custom routed wooden frame with glass cover
- Final detail: Etched Virginia Tech logo on the glass

## Technical Details

The map was created using:

- Baltic birch plywood for durability and clean cutting
- Multiple laser cutter passes for varying depths
- Vector and raster operations for different map elements
- Custom frame routing for professional finish
- Glass overlay for protection and added dimension
